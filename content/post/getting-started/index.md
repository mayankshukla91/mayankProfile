## Overview

My dream job is being part of team building great embedded systems to solve practical problems/challanges.

I have around 8 years of experience in embedded domain, expertise ranging in Automotive, Industrial automation, Medical devices and consumer electronics.

I am expert in C and embedded systems development. Good with Python, MATLAB/Octave, scripting.
I have had my hands on dirty on technologies such as TCP/IP, SoAd, RTOS, communication protocols such as I2C,SPI, UART etc, Linux.
I also have good understanding of MISRA code guidelines, AUTOSAR specs, unit testing \& debugging.
Tools that I have used are Vector tools (DaVinci configurator,CANoe, ASAP2 tools), GHS-Multi, VectorCast, LDRA, PRQA, IBM rational tools (such as Raphsody, RTC and DOOR's), GNU tools, CCS, Keil, MPLAB, wireshark, etc.
